<h3 id="what-is-a-certificate">What is a certificate?</h3>
<blockquote>

  <p>A <strong>certificate</strong> or <strong>digital certificate</strong> is a unique, <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/d/digisig.htm">digitally signed</a> document which authoritatively identifies the identity of an individual or organization. Using <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/pkc.htm">public key cryptography</a>, its authenticity can be verified to ensure that the software or website you are using is legitimate. On the Internet, a certificate is signed by a trusted <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/certificate-authority.htm">CA</a> (certificate authority), and verified with the authority‚Äôs public key. The decrypted certificate contains a verified public key of the certificate holder (website operator), with which encrypted <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/h/http.htm#https">HTTPS</a> communications can be established.</p>

<h3 id="public-key-pair-generation">Public Key Pair Generation</h3>

<ul>
  <li>RSA -&gt; using big prime numbers and based on factoring trap door function, using big keys to provide security</li>
  <li>ECC (Elliptic curve) -&gt; based on mathematical properties of elliptic curves from which next point can be calculated easily (public key), but reversing it almost impossible -&gt; using shorter keys due to it</li>
  <li>DSA -&gt; using discrete logaritmic propertyes and private key generated from the content that we want to sign -&gt; used for ensuring file integrity and verification</li>

  <p>Hierarchy of certificates is used to verify the validity of a certificate‚Äôs issuer. This hierarchy is known as a <em>chain of trust</em>. In a chain of trust, certificates are issued and signed by certificates that live higher up in the hierarchy.</p>

<ul>
  <li>you cannot issue new cert from thrusted public CA certs since you need a new layer</li>

<h2 id="ssl--ssl">SSL / SSL</h2>

<p>TLS, short for Transport Layer Security, and <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledge/base/how-ssl-works/">SSL</a>, short for Secure Socket Layers, are both cryptographic protocols that encrypt data and authenticate a connection when moving data on the Internet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, <strong>TLS is actually just a more recent version of SSL</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>SSL 1.0 ‚Äì never publicly released due to security issues.</li>
  <li>SSL 2.0 ‚Äì released in 1995. Deprecated in 2011. Has known security issues.</li>
  <li>SSL 3.0 ‚Äì released in 1996. Deprecated in 2015. Has known security issues.</li>
  <li>TLS 1.0 ‚Äì released in 1999 as an upgrade to SSL 3.0. Planned deprecation in 2020.</li>
  <li>TLS 1.1 ‚Äì released in 2006. Planned deprecation in 2020.</li>
  <li>TLS 1.2 ‚Äì released in 2008.</li>
  <li>TLS 1.3 ‚Äì released in 2018.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why do we calling the certs SSL cert?
The reason why most people still refer to them as SSL certificates is basically a branding issue. Most major certificate providers still refer to certificates as SSL certificates, which is why the naming convention persists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In reality, all the ‚ÄúSSL Certificates‚Äù that you see advertised are really <strong>SSL/TLS Certificates</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is HTTP<strong>S</strong>?!
This is also where HTTPS comes in (HTTPS stands for ‚ÄúHTTP over SSL/TLS‚Äù).</p>
