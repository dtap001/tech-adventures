Wishing to have a low maintenance blog with static content comes with a conclusion that some framework which lets me write content in markdown and take care everything else would be superb for me.
Little gooogling helped me find Jekull and after one day of trial and error and turning my head around like an owl this is the landscape of ~~Jeckyll~~ (gosh ) Jekyll in my head.
